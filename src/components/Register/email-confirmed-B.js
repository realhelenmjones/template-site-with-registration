        <p>The SDA has just started up so at the moment there's not much to it. To start with we're setting up a message board to enable discussion. Meanwhile please keep an eye on your email, keep coming back to this website or follow updates on the private facebook group .</p>
        
<p>Now you've joined the mighty alliance have you got any thoughts about the following questions that need answering. If we start getting answers we'll create a forum or something to enable discussion.</p>

  
  <ol>
  <li>Are companies able to pay for casual small amounts of work or would they need a contract drawn up (like agencies provide). Would this sort of thing be prohibitive to companies?</li>

  <li>As of 2020 Job Seekers is £73/week. Full-time minimum wage is £8.21/hr or £307/week. What rate should SDA developers be paid? How many days work a week? Perhaps leave that to the companies? Example payment guidelines would be needed though?  Note: SDA is not about getting a proper wage, its about improving upon minimum wage unskilled temporary work
  </li>
  
  

  <li>How to approach companies</li>
<li>What to say to companies - need a template letter/email/flier</li>
<li>Get SDA members to spread the word and contact companies (under the Software Developer Alliance banner).</li>
  </ol>
